# Crop Suitability Predictor

## Overview

**Crop Suitability Predictor** is a data science and machine learning pipeline designed to predict the suitability of different crops for specific locations, primarily based on soil characteristics, satellite imagery, and agricultural data. The project automates the ingestion, processing, and modeling of large geospatial datasets to help researchers, analysts, and agricultural planners make data-driven decisions.

The system integrates the following key data sources:

- **County Yield Reports** â€“ Cleaned and aggregated crop yield and acreage data by county. Also used to retrieve historical maximum yield per crop for benchmarking.
- **Cropland Data Layer (CDL)** â€“ Geospatial crop cover maps used to identify historical crop locations.
- **Landsat NDVI Data** â€“ NDVI values averaged across each cropâ€™s harvest period to estimate vegetative vigor.
- **Soil Data** â€“ Point-level soil characteristics, including physical and chemical properties.

## Features
- Automated ingestion and transformation of raw geospatial and agricultural data
- Processing of soil rasters, crop yield reports, NDVI satellite imagery, and more
- Machine learning model training and evaluation for crop suitability prediction
- Reproducible environment and workflow using Poetry
- Modular, extensible, and well-organized codebase

## ðŸ”§ Pipeline Stages

### 1. Initial Preprocessing

- County-level crop data is cleaned and matched to cropland raster points.
- NDVI values are computed for each crop point over the relevant growing season.
- Soil properties and historical max yields are extracted and joined to each point.

### 2. Data Distribution

- **NDVI-Weighted Yield Allocation**: For each point, a fraction of the total county production is allocated using NDVI as a proxy for productivity.
- **Soil Features**: Each point is enriched with soil characteristics, such as:
  - pH
  - Cation exchange capacity
  - Organic matter
  - Calcium carbonate content
  - Texture

### 3. Suitability Calculation

- **Per-Point Crop Score**: Each point's estimated yield for a crop is compared to that crop's max historical yield to compute a suitability score.
- **Cross-Crop Suitability**:
  - For **numeric soil features**, **Euclidean distance** is used.
  - For **ordinal categorical features**, **cosine distance** is used.
  - An **aggregated distance** is computed by combining both distances, weighted proportionally to the number of numeric vs ordinal features.
  - Suitability for every crop at each point is then inferred based on proximity in this weighted feature space.

### 4. Model Training

- A **LightGBM model** is trained on the computed suitability scores and soil features to predict crop suitability at new locations.


## ðŸ¤– Output

- Normalized suitability scores for each crop at each location
- A trained LightGBM model for inference
- Predicted optimal crop(s) per location

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd crop-suitability-predictor
```

### 2. Install Poetry (if not already installed)
```sh
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```sh
poetry install
```

### 4. Set Up the Data Directory Structure
This project expects a specific data directory structure, as defined in the configuration. To create all necessary directories:

```sh
python setup.py
```
This script will create all required `data/raw` and `data/processed` subdirectories at the location specified by the `PROJECT_PATH` in the config.

### 5. Activate the Poetry Shell (Optional)
```sh
poetry shell
```

## Running the Project

### Data Ingestion
Fetch and prepare raw data:
```sh
poetry run fetch-raw-data
```

### Data Transformation
Process and transform the ingested data:
```sh
poetry run data-transformation
```

### Model Training
Train the crop suitability prediction model:
```sh
poetry run train-model
```

## Testing
Run the test suite with:
```sh
poetry run pytest
```

## Code Quality
Format and lint your code using:
```sh
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .
poetry run flake8
```

## Configuration
- All key paths and settings are managed in `src/crop_suitability_predictor/config/config.py`.
- You can adjust `PROJECT_PATH` and other variables as needed for your environment.
